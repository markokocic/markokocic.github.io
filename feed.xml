&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;freelancing&amp;#95;requirements&amp;#95;in&amp;#95;germany&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Freelancing requirements in Germany&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being freelancer in Germany is not so simple as being freelancer in other parts of the world. It can be very complicated, especially for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not enough to just start working, and worry later about taxes, registration and other legalities. No, you first need to register yourself with the tax office. Then you need to make clear are you &lt;em&gt;Selbständig&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Freiberufler&lt;/em&gt;. While both can be translated as &lt;em&gt;freelancer&lt;/em&gt;, the obligation, legal requirements and bookkeeping differs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;anlage&amp;#95;eür&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Anlage EÜR&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although freelancers are not required to do full double entry accounting, like &lt;strong&gt;GMBH&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;UG&lt;/strong&gt;, they are required to report their earnings at the end of the year in a consolidated way, by submitting the so called &lt;strong&gt;Anlage-EÜR&lt;/strong&gt; to the tax office. Being Freiberufler, one is theoretically not required to fill in the form, but I heard all kind of stories that tax people don't like it when you make it more complicated to them, and not submitting Anlage-EÜR electronically is definitelly more work for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;jes-eür&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jes-EÜR&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of programs that allows one to do bookkeeping, most of them commercial, with varying quality and pricing. Working primarily on Linux, and not even owning a Windows machine, makes the choice much worse. Only a few of commercially available software support non-Windows platforms, and non-windows usually means Mac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of online software packages, but they always seemed a bit limited compared to the full desktop version. And I don't like subscription model where I lose all data and convenience when I decide to stop paying for the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then I came around the &lt;a href='http://jes-eur.de/'&gt;Jes-Eür&lt;/a&gt;. It's a nice Java based cross platform program that allows to track income and expenses, categorize them in the standard categories, and provide a report that can be used to submit Anlage-EÜR. Granted, it is missing an option to automatically submit it to the tax office, but it provides printout with explanation that would make filling in the form on the official tax department web site a two minutes of effor. I even like it more that way, since it gives an impression of the control during the process.&lt;/p&gt;

Quickly improve web browsing privacy
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;While browsing Hacker News &lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10470535'&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; just got to this small tip for improving web browsing privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; I use Firefox and install the following: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disconnect&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ublock Origin (choose 3rd-Party block lists to suit.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Privacy Badger (no set up, just install, it learns as you go)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In Firefox, use about:config to change the following: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle dom.storage.enabled to False&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle layout.css.visited&lt;i&gt;links&lt;/i&gt;enabled to False&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle media.peerconnection.enabled to False&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle network.prefetch-next to False&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle network.http.sendReferrerHeader to 0 (zero)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toggle network.http.sendSecureXSiteReferrer to False&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;These settings have worked for me with no issues. I bank, do all manner of things online with no issues. I do, however, see no ads, no tracking, faster page loads, clean experience all around. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it would be too paranoid, but there's no real drawbacks trying it. While the advice is about Firefox, I'm sure something similar could be achieved with Chrome, at least to some extent.&lt;/p&gt;

Markdown vs Asciidoc
</title>
<description>
&lt;p&gt;While playing around with this &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org'&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt; based blog genertor, very soon I hit the limit. It was very easy to get started, I even put some (moderate) effort and very quickly adapted my &lt;a href='/pages/marko-kocic-cv.html'&gt;CV&lt;/a&gt; using Markdown syntax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process is very easy. Just copy the content from the web page, paste it to the new file, and adapt a few things to fit the Markdown syntax. The resulting page looks quite usable, except for the few details. For example, in the &quot;Personal data&quot; section it is not possible to have picture on the left side, and personal details on the right. Also, I'd prefer to have columns aligned there. It's a small thing, a matter of preference, but those small things can become annoying pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That would be a perfect case for HTML tables, but Markdwn, as basic as it is, doesn't support table-like formatting. After looking around a bit, I found out that Asciidoc do support tables, as well as manu other more advance formatting options. It is so similar to Markdown, that could even be considered as a superset of it. Except that it isn't. There are some changes, namely the links formatting and few more small things. I'd like to give it a try, but I'm too lazy to convert all of my content here (all three pages).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cryogen does support both Markdown and Asciidoc, but not the mixture. You either need one or another for all pages and blog posts. I can't see a reason why it couldn't distinguish the engine type by file extension, and allow for mixed sources. I think I would just open a Cryogen feature request and see if someone else is interested in it. I may even do it myself when I find some time, but I'm sure people already familiar with the code base would do it much faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update: The Github issue to allow different formats for  individual pages is &lt;a href='https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen-core/issues/48'&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

First Post
</title>
<description>
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;this&amp;#95;is&amp;#95;my&amp;#95;first&amp;#95;post!&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is my first post!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been playing around with the idea of finally updating my &quot;Home Page&quot;. Before, it was only my CV hosted on the Google AppEngine, but it became kindo of annoying to update it regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about setting up something simpler. Didn't like the idea of having to set up the whole full featured blogging platform like Wordpress or similar. I wanted something simlpe, something that I could easily update, preferably using any text editor, and which wouldn't require more than Apache web server to host it. Thus, I started looking at static web site generators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I came around the &lt;a href='http://cryogenweb.org'&gt;Cryogen&lt;/a&gt;, I was sold. It looked exactly what I needed, so I decided to start my personal &quot;site&quot; using it.&lt;/p&gt;
